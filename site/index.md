This site is the public entry point for the **Systems Thinking on Apple Silicon** *curriculum* and its *companion tools*.
It provides stable documentation, orientation, and distribution links.

## Who is this for?

We are developing a *community*, an *ecosystem*, a *distributed network of local nodes*.

If you are interested in:

  - systems programming
  - MacOS architecture and internals
  - Arm (or x86) on Apple
  - Zig

you may find learning here.

Systems programmers are needed in the Apple ecosystem. 

People who love the machine and want to understand how things work.

You can join a community of like-minded individuals interested in this space.

Long term goals are tooling for GPU programming and leveraging the Metal API.

We are in the early stages of methodically building a logical sequence of courses to enable systems programmers for this target.
