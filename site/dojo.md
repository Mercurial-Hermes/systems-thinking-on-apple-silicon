Dojo is the macOS application that consumes this curriculum repository at runtime.
It handles access, execution environments, and user experience independently of this repository.

This site documents the public interface Dojo relies on, rather than the Dojo UI itself.

## Download

Official macOS packages will be linked here when available.
Until then, refer to the repository releases or distribution channel provided by the project.
