Dipole is a companion instrument that evolves alongside the curriculum.
It is not presented as a finished product, and it does not explain systems.
It exposes them.

The curriculum treats Dipole as an instrument under construction, used to observe execution with restraint and precision.

Indeed usage of Dipole in the curriculum will push the development of Dipole forward.

## Goals

Dipole is aiming at being a debugger and pedagogical exploration tool, of value to students and professional developments.

The state of the art debugging tool used on x86 and arm binaries on macOS is [*llvm*](https://lldb.llvm.org).

Dipole doesn't seek to be the next `llvm`.

It seeks to leverage it for ergonomic and pedagogical reasons.
