# Hexdump-Lite

**Seeing Bytes Faithfully**

## Epistemic Goal

Learn how to observe bytes on disk **without interpretation**.

This course exists to teach restraint.

Before programs execute, before formats are explained, before intent is inferred, there must be a way to look at reality as it exists — not as we hope it does.

---

## What Is Built

Learners build **`hdl`**, a deliberately minimal hexdump utility.

The tool:

* reads bytes from disk
* displays them in a stable, predictable form
* refuses to explain what those bytes *mean*

`hdl` is not designed to compete with existing tools.
It is designed to be *understood completely*.

---

## Core Ideas

This course establishes several ideas that will be treated as invariants for the remainder of the curriculum:

* Programs are physical artifacts
* Bytes exist before meaning
* Structure precedes explanation
* Tools are lenses with moral weight
* Faithful observation is a skill, not a default

Learners are repeatedly asked to slow down and answer a single question:

> *What is actually present?*

---

## Deliberate Constraints

To preserve epistemic clarity, the tool and the course enforce constraints:

* No parsing of formats
* No symbolic interpretation
* No guessing
* No “helpful” explanations

The tool prints bytes.
Nothing more.

If the tool were to invent structure, infer meaning, or hide irregularity, it would be lying.

## Why This Course Comes First

Many curricula begin with execution, APIs, or abstractions.

This curriculum does not.

Without the ability to observe artifacts faithfully, every later tool becomes an act of trust rather than understanding.

This course establishes a baseline:

* comfort with raw data
* patience in the presence of complexity
* discipline in refusing premature explanation

Nothing later assumes more than this.

---

## Outcome

By the end of this course, learners:

* Own a tool they fully understand
* Can inspect binaries, data files, and executables calmly
* Recognise when other tools are *interpreting*, not observing
* Are prepared to encounter structure without rushing to meaning

This course is intentionally quiet.

Its success is measured not by how much is learned, but by how much unnecessary explanation is resisted.

---

## Status

This course is **available** and forms the foundation of the curriculum.

All later courses assume its habits.
