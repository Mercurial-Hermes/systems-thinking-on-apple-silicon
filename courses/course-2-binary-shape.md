# Binary Shape and Format

**Declared Structure Without Interpretation**

## Epistemic Goal

Learn to recognise **declared structure** as an objective fact.

This course exists to teach that structure is not opinion, inference, or convenience.
It is something that has been **asserted**, and therefore must be respected.

---

## What Is Built

Learners build a **structural binary inspection tool**.

The tool:

* identifies declared regions within binary artifacts
* exposes layout, boundaries, and offsets
* refuses to assign meaning beyond what is explicitly stated

It is aware of binary formats — but it does not *explain* them.

The goal is not comprehension.
The goal is **faithful recognition of structure**.

---

## Core Ideas

This course deepens the discipline established in *Hexdump-Lite* by introducing formal structure:

* Formats are contracts
* Contracts create facts
* Layout exists independently of interpretation
* Names do not add meaning
* Explanation is optional; correctness is not

Learners encounter real, complex binaries and are asked to do something difficult:

> *Stand in front of structure without narrating it.*

---

## Deliberate Constraints

To preserve epistemic clarity, the course enforces strict limits:

* No semantic interpretation of fields
* No symbolic resolution
* No execution
* No speculation about intent

Headers are treated as boundaries.
Tables are treated as declarations.
Offsets are treated as facts.

If the structure is inconsistent, that inconsistency must be shown — not explained away.

---

## Why This Course Follows Hexdump-Lite

In the previous course, learners saw bytes.

In this course, learners confront the reality that **bytes are not free-form**.

They are arranged deliberately.

This introduces a new kind of pressure:

* the pressure to respect boundaries
* the pressure to accept declared facts
* the pressure to admit when structure contradicts expectation

This course completes Phase I.

Nothing moves yet.
But much has already been committed.

---

## Outcome

By the end of this course, learners:

* Can inspect real binaries without rushing to meaning
* Understand formats as authoritative contracts
* Recognise when tools invent structure
* Are prepared to encounter execution without myth

They leave with a strengthened habit:

> *If structure is declared, it must be obeyed.*

---

## Status

This course is **in development** and remains **free**.

It closes the observation phase of the curriculum and prepares learners for execution in the next phase.
